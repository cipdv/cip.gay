Here are some potential security vulnerabilities and improvements that can be made in this code:

Exposure of sensitive data in error messages: The error messages returned by the registerNewMember and login functions might expose sensitive information about the system. It's generally a good practice to log the error details for debugging purposes but return a generic error message to the user.

Lack of rate limiting: There doesn't seem to be any rate limiting in place for the registerNewMember and login functions. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform a brute force attack to guess a user's password.

Use of console.log for error logging: The console.log function is being used to log errors in the registerNewMember function. This is not a good practice for production code as it can lead to sensitive information being exposed. It's better to use a proper logging library that can handle sensitive information appropriately.

No validation on registration data: In the registerNewMember function, there doesn't seem to be any validation on the registration data. This could potentially allow an attacker to register with invalid or malicious data.

Potential Session Hijacking: The session cookie is being set with httpOnly: true, which is good because it prevents the cookie from being accessed via JavaScript on the client side. However, the secure flag is not set, which means the cookie could be transmitted over an insecure connection. This could potentially allow an attacker to intercept the cookie and hijack the user's session. The secure flag should be set to true to ensure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.

Potential JWT Secret Exposure: The JWT secret key is being stored in an environment variable, which is generally a good practice. However, if the environment variables are not properly secured, this could potentially lead to the secret key being exposed. It's important to ensure that environment variables are properly secured and not exposed in any logs or error messages.

Potential Timing Attack: The bcrypt.compare function is used to compare the hashed password with the user's input. While bcrypt is resistant to timing attacks, it's still a good practice to ensure that all paths in the authentication process take a constant amount of time to prevent potential timing attacks.
